exercisestatement## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

The first point that resonated with me is being able to take on challenging tasks I do not understand. I did this not only to seek the challenge, but to grow. I have a very abrupt realization over this last year that we are all clueless humans walking around figuring things out as we go. While there are specialists with a degree of expertise even these specialists are clueless have the time. It's their determination to grow and figure problems out that makes them an expert. The second point that was a new concept to me was taking a mental note/action when theres something you're struggling with. I have always just blinding thrown myself into a problem, but examining why I don't understand something could be crucial for growth.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I currently demonstrate growth mindset in my determination to figure things out. The last occupation I held was a startup where I was thrown into new foreign things everyday. I could have given up but instead took them time to figure out these complex systems one by one. I do not demonstrate a growth mindset on how I approach difficult problems at times. I can get into the habit of beating my head against a wall trying to figure something out for hours instead of just asking for help.
Something I am good now that I originally was not is google advertising and email marketing. This was something completely foreign to me, but was given the task of taking it over and figuring out at my last position. I still can't say i'm amazing at it, but I will say I am good from where I started. I digested a couple dozen hours of video tutorials and browsed hundreds of forum pages just to be able to say i'm proficient with the process. It was difficult diving into something completely new, but I am happy to say that I figured out a new skill.

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

I felt very comfortable with it. In the last section I had issues running the copy and pasted node command so I figured out how it worked then. That made it real simple for this time.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A condition statement is a set of instructions to evaluate variables and choose an outcome based on what the operator instructions are. A conditional statement could be as simple as breakfast. Condition statement would be, if fruit > 0 I will make a parfait. if else if bagels > 0 I will make bagel with cream cheese. For a website lets use REI and discounts. When a user returns to the website it checks their token and validates if this previous user is a member. "If" the user is a member, then show deals and discounts for members only. "If else" this user is not a member, show regular products and no special deals.

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

I would use logical operators to make sure that both conditions are meet with either true's or false's to then print the correct log to the console. The && logical operator only produces a True result when both conditions are True and the inverse of that is || producing a false result only when both conditions are false. I saw that there are two more logical operators ! and ?? which i need to look into.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

You can use logical operators to make sure that you are receiving the expected output. You can also adjust the variable values to ensure the output is whats expected at these different values.

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

Is there a limit to how many conditional you can apply with logical operators. for example (" " && " " && " "), could this have as many assigned variables as I want? Also will we receive any exercises on switch statements. If not ill take the time to go practice those.
